- battle.net-style chat for IRC. all channels user is in appears in one chat area at once. 
- mozilla swag exchange - marketplace for stickers/promo items given to mozillians. would let users display swag they were willing to trade, how they were willing to trade it (at an all hands vs via post), etc.
  - bonus addendum: track how many of each sticker exists on the marketplace, determine a "stock" price (e.g., a foxkeh sticker would be worth 15 "standard firefox logo stickers", or two run the tools stickers)
